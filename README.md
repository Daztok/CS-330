# CS-330
How do I approach designing software?
I tend to approach software development slow and methodically. Similar to this class I would outline smaller goals within the project and finish them one at a time. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I had no graphic design knowledge or skills prior to this class. I have had an entirely new world opened up to me after experiencing openGL.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Well, each week had us apply what we learned into our project. As I said earlier, I would've most likely done something similar to this as I was working on my project anyway. For this class specifically, we learned to put shapes into our scenes, then textures, camera controls, and lighting. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think slow and methodical is the best option for working with code. That way I am able to test tangible things as I'm working (i.e. are these the right shapes I wanted? Is this where I wanted that object? etc...)

How do I approach developing programs?
Programs would be similar to how I approach software development. Define goals and expectations with timeframes and attempt to meet those goals without making the program as a whole "brick."

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I have never done graphic design or used OpenGL in any way. This was new for me as I have rarely done anything as tangible as this project. I did do a lot more peer to peer sessions in order to problem solve which really helped out. The SNHU Student Discord is a great place to ask questions and get great help.

How did iteration factor into your development?
With little knowledge with OpenGL, when we had to apply each weeks lesson not only to the weekly assignment but our main project as well, it allowed me to understand what to do and how each weeks code worked and why it mattered. With this course and the CS330 Content folder containing many of the pre-built programs we needed, it allowed me to understand what the pre-built programs were doing and how they integrate into the project as a whole.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I think at this point, my practice of developing is pretty set. I like to go slow and methodical and it worked well with this course's project as well.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science is necessary to understand the tech industry on a holistic level. Having experience in networking, graphic design, and software development allows me to understand the roles and requirements each aspect of our job.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Honestly, other than just having knowledge of OpenGL and 3D rendering, I'm not sure how it will be applied in future classes. I think because of this class, I am less scared to ask for help. I can see that some others had similar questions to mine and it allowed us to come together to solve our problems.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As mentioned in the goals, having a holistic understanding of coding is necessary when you move up in positional authority at a company. As a leader, it is important to understand what goes into each job and being able to know the capabilities one would need in order to accomplish goals for a specific role.
